			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I am senior at University of Rochester and I'm majoring in Business Entrepreneurship. I am a researcher, activist and writer of social entrepreneurship and social innovation. I worked on a research project in Beijing and Shenzhen investigating how Chinese social entrepreneurs help migrant workers integrate into urban society in China. The phenomenon of large-scale rural-urban migration has brought 250 million migrant workers into urban cities in China. Migrant workers face tremendous legal barriers under the hukou system, which excludes non-urban residents from social welfare. </p>

I also worked for a venture capital firm in Kuala Lumpur where I streamlined deal-sourcing and worked with entrepreneurs help them achieve their goals.</p>
