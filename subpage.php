		<p>I am a student at University of Rochester and my major is Computer Science. I will graduate the school in this December. Previously, I studied at North American University and there I worked as a part-time front web developer. I designed there the college's sports and IT websites. Recently, I started to work on a website for a toy store and I'm still working on the design and integrating ecommerce functionalities to it. Also, I am developing a mobile application for selling local farm goods. Here is a list of the projects I have worked on. Toyzland.com - this is a website that sells toys online. I made this ecommerce website for my friend's store. LoyalFarm - it is a mobile app that lets people to buy their groceries online. I am now working on this project and soon it will be possible to use, hopefully, before the end of this year.

		<p>I am currently a senior who is majoring in Computer Science. I am also an international student from Uganda, East Africa currently studying in the United States. My belief in education to make a positive change has always been a driving factor in my academics, work and travel. My hope is that to learn the necessary skills in computer science, finance and management to lead organizations and companies that will make a fundamental change in our world. My love for numbers and making a change in the world has resulted in me taking an interest in Business, Computer Science & Robotics. During my Junior year, I went to study abroad in Shanghai, China which was a life changing experience. Aside from the great food that I enjoyed, I got a chance to put my python programming skills into practice. I worked with a startup called, MIRO AI - a sports AI company. </p>
