			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I am a student at University of Rochester studying Computer Science. I will graduate the school in this December. Previously, I studied at North American University and there I worked as a part-time front web developer. I designed there the college's sports and IT websites. Recently, I started to work on a website for a toy store and I'm still working on the design and integrating ecommerce functionalities to it. Also, I am developing a mobile application for selling local farm goods. </p>
